            Fashion has the incredible power to make us feel confident,
            empowered, and inspired. But did you know it can also serve as a
            form of self-care and mental health advocacy? Welcome to the world
            of Mental Health Awareness Fashion – where style meets purpose, and
            every piece of clothing is a statement of support for mental
            wellness.
